Update as of 9/26/21:
Websending is unable to be worked on atm for the reason being that I am busy with education, and do not have any support or programmers to help me.

Update as of 7/29/22:
I still currently have no team mates to help with this project, I also started off with the wrong language.

Update as of 1/8/23:
I have written a mini command prompt in Java with which the user may also add their own commands with some Java experience.

Update as of 3/21/24:
I have made and implemented some commands, error handling has yet got to be added, as well as some commands to be fixed. Open to feedback and pull requests. With that being said, I'll push the code out right now! Use it at your own risk I should say.
