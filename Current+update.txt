Update as of 9/26/21:
Websending is unable to be worked on atm for the reason being that I am busy with education, and do not have any support or programmers to help me.

Update as of 7/29/22:
I still currently have no team mates to help with this project, I also started off with the wrong language.

Update as of 1/8/23:
I have written a mini command prompt in Java with which the user may also add their own commands with some Java experience.
